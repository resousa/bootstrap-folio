### Summary

This portfolio is a continuation of the first portfolio I made. I took my intial portfolio style and recreated it with Bootstrap. There were a few key areas that I was focusing on for this project. The first of whichq was limiting the use of CSS. I was able to go from 33 pieces of CSS down to 9. The second element of focus was utilizing the Bootstrap grid system to create a responsive layout that can be used on a variety of screen sizes. I believe I was able to create fairly clean code overall to recreate my first portfolio.
